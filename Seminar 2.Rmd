**Answer** 

| Stages      | Description |
| :---        |    :----:   |
| 1     | Problem understanding       |
| 2     | Analytic approach        |
| 3     | Data requirements       |
| 4     | Data collection        |
| 5     | Data understanding       |


> 6.  Create an ordered list of at least 3 other Data Science
>     methodologies.

**Answer** 
1.CRISP-DM
2.TDSP
3.OSEMN

> 7.  Provide and ordered list the weaknesses of the CRISP-DM
>     methodology and how to address them

**Answer** 
1.Weakness of CRISP-DM
* Outdated
* Documentation heavy
* Not a project management approach
* Can ignore stakeholders
* Slow start

2. Solutions
* Define team roles
* Combine with a team coordination process
* Document enough...but not too much
* Iterate quickly
* Ensure actionable insight
*Add phases if needed and subitems


> 8.  Download and include a University of Warwick Logo in your
>     document.

> 9.  Write and execute a code to randomly generate 10 numbers from a
>     normal distribution with mean 12 and standard deviation 3.

**Answer**

```{r}
rnorm (n=10, mean=12, sd=3)

```


> 10. Write and execute a code to calculate the mean of 12 random
>     numbers generated from the interval of integers from 5 to 25.

**Answer**

```{r}
floor(runif(n=12,min=5,max=25))
```


> 11. Write and execute a code to create a scatter plot containing 12
>     points whose coordinates were randomly geenrated in the interval 5
>     to 25. Provide a title for the figure, label the x and y axis.

**Answer**

```{r}
set.seed(13333)
library(ggplot2)
df<-floor(runif(n=12,min=5,max=25))
x<-floor(runif(n=12,min=5,max=25))
plot(x,df)

plot(x=sample(5:25,12), y=sample(5:25,12), main="Twelve random points", xlab="X values", ylab="Y values")
```

**Answer**

```{r}
s<-rnorm (n=15, mean=12, sd=3)
sd<-sd(s)
sd

exists("se")
se <- function(a) {
  x<- var(a)
  y<- length(a)
  return(sqrt(x/y))
}
testEg <- rnorm(15, mean=12, sd=3)
se(testEg)
